# Notes

This model is trained on the training, validation, and test splits for evaluation on the challenge set. The frames are from the 720p videos, downsampled to 224 pixels high. The challenge frames are from the 224p videos due to possible offset issues in the 720p challenge videos (unknown if these issues have been fixed).
